README for pwm password manager

pwm is the simplest possible secure, convenient, terminal-based password 
manager. It uses openssl to symmetrically encrypt arbitrary text (usernames, 
passwords, or whatever you want) to small files, one per entry.  The default 
cipher used is aes256, the default location of these files is ~/.pwmdb, and the 
default editor is vi; all these can be specified on the command line.  The 
program is a single bash script and requires no arguments for normal operation.

When run, it presents a small menu of choices, including a help choice.  Lookup 
of stored entries is facilitated with readline, since stored entries are simply 
files in a directory.
