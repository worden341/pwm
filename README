README for pwm password manager

pwm is the simplest possible secure, convenient, terminal-based password 
manager. It uses GPG to encrypt arbitrary text (usernames, passwords, or 
whatever you want) to small files, one per entry. The default location of these 
files is ~/.pwmdb, and the default editor is vi; all these can be specified on 
the command line or pwmrc file as environment variable settings.  The program is 
a single bash script and requires no arguments for normal operation.

When run, it presents a small menu of choices, including a help choice.  Lookup 
of stored entries is facilitated with readline, since stored entries are simply 
files in a directory.

You need to have GPG working on your system, and be sure to back up your keys. 
You may find it useful to configure an automatically running gpg-agent if one 
is not already running on your system.
